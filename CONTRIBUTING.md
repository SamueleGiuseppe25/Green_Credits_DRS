# Contributing to GreenCredits

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines to help us keep a clean and efficient workflow.

## Workflow

- Use feature branches named `feat/<short-description>` for new features.
- Use `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes and `chore/<short-description>` for maintenance work.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) early for visibility. Mark it as draft if it's still in progress.
- Every PR must be reviewed by at least one teammate before merge.
- Update documentation alongside your changes:
  - `docs/requirements.md` for requirement changes
  - `docs/adr/` for architecture/tech decisions

## Commit messages

- Keep messages concise and descriptive.
- Reference issues when relevant, e.g., `Fixes #123`.

## Code style & quality

- Frontend: follow project linters/formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
- Backend: follow Python formatting (e.g., Black/Ruff) or the chosen stack's conventions.
- Add or update tests where applicable.

## Pull Requests

- Provide a summary of changes and testing notes.
- Ensure CI checks pass.
- Request review from code owners or relevant teammates.

Thank you for contributing!
